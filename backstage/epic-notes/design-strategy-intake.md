# Epic: Design Strategy Intake

**Status:** 🏗️ ACTIVE (Main Epic)  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-13

---

## Context

**The fundamental insight:**

A design strategist defines resources and talents a company needs **BEFORE** branding strategist, **BEFORE** everything else.

**What triggered this:**
- Started onboarding for design studio concept
- Question: How to structure decision process?
- Result: Built something bigger — multi-project governance system with cognitive & relational economy

---

## The Six Layers

### 🧱 Layer 1 — What Already Existed (Backstage)

**Backstage protocol already solves:**
- Roadmap → intention
- Epics → self-contained units
- Branches → experimentation
- Merge → stability
- Changelog → public memory

**This is disciplined execution. Problem was NOT here.**

---

### 🧠 Layer 2 — What Emerged: Meta-Project

**Key realization:** The company is NOT a project. It's a project ABOVE projects.

**Meta-Project (Portfolio) manages:**
- Multiple projects
- Cognitive currency allocation
- Priority decisions
- Coherence between Life and Business

**This solves:**
- Focus conflicts
- Overcommitment
- Guilt about dormant projects

---

### 🪜 Layer 3 — Tier System

**Critical refinement:** Tier ≠ success. **Tier = how much cognitive energy can be invested.**

**Structural example:**
- **Tier A** → high energy
- **Tier B** → medium energy
- **Tier C** → incubation
- **Tier D** → preserved dormancy

**Decision criteria (hybrid):**
- Automation (engagement, subscribers)
- Ethics
- Security
- Liability
- Strategic value
- Niche value

**Crucial correction:** Not everything needs to grow. Small projects can have high community currency.

---

### 🔁 Layer 4 — Continuous Calibration Ritual

**The system's real DNA:**

1. What moves up/down tiers?
2. What does each tier enable?
3. What can be automated?
4. What needs human judgment?

**This is adaptive governance.** Not fixed. Periodic review with structural stability.

---

### 📢 Layer 5 — Strategic Engagement

**The real gap identified:**

Every Epic that goes to Changelog needs:
- Announcement
- Defined audience
- Clear ask (call to action)
- Mini-campaign

**You don't want money. You want:**
- Tests
- Feedback
- Promotion
- Interpretation
- Participation

**This is operationalized relational economy.**

---

### 🌐 Layer 6 — Transparency & Enthusiasts

**You want:**
- Open process
- Visible justification
- Readable roadmap
- External participation

**But with filter.**

**Enthusiasts:**
- No formal credentials
- Have good faith
- Can generate unexpected value
- Need curation

**Mature understanding:** Transparency ≠ absence of criteria.

---

## The Core Question Evolution

**Original question:** How to structure decision process?

**Final answer (expanded):**

Decision process now has **3 levels:**

1. **Technical decision** (Backstage)
2. **Allocation decision** (Tier)
3. **Amplification decision** (public engagement)

---

## Next Strategic Question

**How to design a lightweight, repeatable mini-campaign system per Epic, without exhaustion?**

**Or more fundamental:**

**Do you want the company to be primarily a laboratory, or a public narrative machine?**

This defines engagement weight.

---

## Possible Next Pulls

1. **Communication architecture per tier** (what to announce where, when)
2. **Ideal portfolio review frequency** (quarterly? monthly? moon-aligned?)
3. **Lightweight mini-campaign replicable model** (template, checklist, automation)
4. **Company's central thesis definition** (what is nonlinear about, fundamentally?)

---

## Findings So Far

**Design Strategist Role:**
- Defines resources & talents needed
- Comes BEFORE branding
- Comes BEFORE everything else
- Sets foundation for company structure

**Multi-Project Governance:**
- Meta-project manages portfolio
- Cognitive currency = finite resource
- Tier system = energy allocation
- Calibration = ongoing ritual

**Relational Economy:**
- Not about money
- About participation, feedback, interpretation
- Mini-campaigns per shipped epic
- Transparency with criteria

---

## Open Questions

1. **Primary identity:** Laboratory or narrative machine?
2. **Mini-campaign architecture:** How lightweight? How repeatable?
3. **Review frequency:** When to calibrate tiers?
4. **Enthusiast curation:** What's the filter? Who decides?
5. **Swarm/agents idea:** How does multi-agent coordination fit into this?

## Notes

**This is the MAIN epic for nonlinear.** Everything else supports this.

**Pin:** Decision process = Technical (Backstage) + Allocation (Tier) + Amplification (Engagement)

**Next:** Define company identity (laboratory vs narrative machine) to calibrate engagement weight.
